# Blockchain Project

## Introduction
This is a blockchain-based project that aims to [briefly describe what your project does, e.g., create a decentralized application, build a simple blockchain, implement a smart contract, etc.]. The project is designed to [mention goals, e.g., demonstrate blockchain principles, support a specific application, provide a learning resource].

## Features
- **Decentralization**: [Explain how the project uses decentralization, e.g., nodes, peer-to-peer network].
- **Transparency**: [Describe how data is accessible and transparent in your project].
- **Security**: [Explain the security measures, e.g., cryptographic techniques, consensus algorithms].
- **Immutability**: [Describe how immutability is ensured, e.g., through hashing].

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain Framework**: [e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, or a custom-built blockchain]
- **Programming Language**: [e.g., Solidity, JavaScript, Python]
- **Smart Contracts**: [e.g., Solidity for Ethereum-based projects]
- **Libraries**: [Mention any libraries, e.g., Web3.js, ethers.js]
